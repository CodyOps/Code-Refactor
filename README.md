## Project Title

Code Refactor

## Description

_Quick description about this project_

The purpose of this project is to take existing code and refactor it (improve code without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement new technologies. The goal was to make the site for a marketing agency more accessible. An important rule followed in this project was using the Scout Rule, which is to leave the code a little cleaner that when you found it. All of the links have been refactored to function correctly, HTML elements have been refactored to be more semantic.
